## Chapters

### **Chapter 1: Data Preparation & Cleanup**
- Imported dataset: `Global_Cybersecurity_Threats_2015â€“2024.csv`.
- Dataset resource: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024
- Removed inconsistencies, ensured proper data types, and renamed columns for clarity.
- Converted financial loss values into the numeric format and parsed dates appropriately.

### **Chapter 2: Power BI Dashboard Creation**
- Designed a clean, responsive dashboard using a modern layout.
- Used slicers for filtering by year, country, and attack type.
- Integrated various chart types:
  - Donut chart: Total number of attacks by attack type
  - Line & bar charts: Year-wise trends
  - Stacked bar: Affected users by industry or country
  - Matrix table: Attack source analysis
  - Slicer: Attack type in which country in which year
  - KPI: Overall Loss or Profit

### **Chapter 3: Insights Derived**
- Phishing, DDoS, and Ransomware attacks were most frequent.
- Banking, IT, and Healthcare industries faced the highest number of attacks.
- Nation-state and insider threats contributed significantly to total incidents.
- Financial loss spiked in specific years due to massive breaches.
